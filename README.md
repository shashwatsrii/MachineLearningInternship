# MachineLearning


Machine Learning Models Implementations and Files i studied during my Summer Internship at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The major skills I learned during the internship were the Fundamentals of Machine Learning, Data Analysis and MLOps.

Some of the models I implemented were:
1. Linear Regression Model.
2. Polynomial Regression Model.
3. Logistic Regression Model.
4. Artificial Neural Networks.

Some of the datasets I implemented were:
1. Salary - Experience Model using Linear Regression.
2. Loan Data Analysis : Dataset from Kaggle for EDA.
3. Titanic Dataset : Randomly picked up for EDA.
4. Salary_position Dataset : Randomly Picked up for Polynomial Regression.
5. Iris Dataset : Popular UCI ML Dataset for Logistic Regression.
6. Pima Indians Diabetes Database : Owned by National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
